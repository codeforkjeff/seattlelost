A coffee shop on [[Capitol Hill]] with a goth industrial vibe. 

== History ==

Paige Kayner opened the coffee shop in 1999.

Aurafice was especially busy in the evenings, when a lot of goth kids
in their teens and early 20s would hang out, listen to music, play
board games, and of course, drink coffee. During the day, it was
rarely packed, which made it a comfortable place to hang out.

It was among the first coffee shops in Seattle to have computers you
could rent to use the Internet.

== Memories ==

I spent many afternoons reading here. The window tables were great for
people-watching on Pine. Paige was always super nice to me, and we
often shared a smoke at one of the sidewalk tables. -- Jeff
